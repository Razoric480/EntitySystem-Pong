EntitySystem Pong is a small, windows based Pong game. It makes use of the Entity System heavily taking from the RDBMS beta approach as described on http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/rdbms-with-code-in-systems . The software is presented as is under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file.

The software uses the winmm.dll to make use of timeGetTime, and uses the win32 API to gain access to the advanced console. This functionality is wrapped up into GameClock and ConsoleHandler and so could be ported, however non-trivially.
